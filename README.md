# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME-USING-MIN-MAX WITH THE LEVELS

In this game ,either the computer wins or game is drawn.
I have used the MIN-MAX algorithm , a heuristic function that always chooses the best move !!! 

This code shows the successors for the computers move and their score for the corresponding move .
Also levels are based on the n-ply search.
ex. 
   depth == 1 --> user can also win this case 
   depth == 2 --> only computer win's or match draw's
   depth == 3 == 4 --> same as depth 2.
   
In depth 1 i.e one ply search , you can notice that how the computer is making mistake and why there should be atleast 2 ply search to draw the game or to defeat the user ( we can say to help the computer to win the game ). 

Below is the example for one ply search in which user is playing first
